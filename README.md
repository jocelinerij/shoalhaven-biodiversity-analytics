# Endangered Shorebird Conservation in Shoalhaven — Data-Driven Flora Prioritisation

This project, conducted by **BioNest Analytics**, supports a government revegetation initiative in the Shoalhaven region of NSW. Using a data-driven methodology, we prioritized native flora species that best support the survival of five endangered flagship shorebird species under future climate conditions.

The flagship species are:
- Little Tern
- Eastern Curlew
- Bar-Tailed Godwit
- Great Knot
- Curlew Sandpiper

Our work combines **spatial species mapping**, **climate forecasting (ARIMA & NARCliM models)**, and **species distribution modeling (GLM)** to provide scientifically supported recommendations for biodiversity conservation in wetlands.

## Project Goals
- Identify high-priority subregions for revegetation within Shoalhaven
- Forecast Shoalhaven’s climate conditions (2023–2039)
- Map geolocation data of potential native flora
- Select 5 flora species most suitable for future conditions and shorebird support

---

## Final Flora Recommendations
Based on data modeling and ecological analysis, the five recommended species are:
- **Banksia Robur**
- **Boronia Deanei**
- **Avicennia Marina**
- **Carpobrotus Edulis**
- **Carpobrotus Glaucescens**
